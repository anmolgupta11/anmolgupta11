### Hi there 👋! Glad to see you here 😄

As you must have realised by now, Hi, I am Anmol! I am currently an undergraduate student from IIT BHU Varanasi, India. I have experience in Natural Language Processing and have built next-gen PaaS platforms.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on building mini applications using Python. Feel free to check out my profile and yes, _suggestions are always welcome_ ✨

- 💬 Ask me about anything I have written ⁠— we can have a nice chat virtually or if possible, we can meet over a cup of coffee ☕

- 📫 You can reach me on my [Portfolio](https://anmolgupta11.github.io/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anmol-gupta-9520a914a/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/anmolg.gupta/) or you can even drop me a mail at mail.anmolgupta@gmail.com

- ⚡ Fun fact — I like tea more than coffee. Also, I like Breaking Bad more than Dark and I seldom write too.
